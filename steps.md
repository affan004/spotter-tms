## 🎙️ Section-by-Section Walkthrough Script

---

### Part 1: Introduction & System Architecture (0:00 – 0:45)
**🖥️ On Screen:** Open your browser to [https://spotter-ai-tms.vercel.app](https://spotter-ai-tms.vercel.app). Show the clean dark-mode TMS interface.

**🗣️ What to Say:**
> *"Hello everyone! My name is Affan, and this is my submission for the Spotter.ai Transportation Management System assessment.*
>
> *I’ve built a full-stack, enterprise-grade FMCSA Hours of Service and automated Electronic Logging Device engine.*
>
> *The frontend is built in React using Vite, Leaflet with high-contrast CartoDB tiles, and an interactive SVG log grid. The backend is powered by Python and Django REST Framework, running a deterministic state machine that enforces strict property 49 CFR Part 395 regulations.*
>
> *Our system is live and hosted on Vercel at `spotter-ai-tms.vercel.app`, and the complete source code is publicly accessible on GitHub."*

---

### Part 2: Trip Planning, Deadhead Routing & Live Simulation (0:45 – 1:45)
**🖥️ On Screen:** In the form on the left, click the **"Midwest to Texas"** preset button (or type *Current: Indianapolis, IN*, *Pickup: Indianapolis, IN*, *Dropoff: Dallas, TX*, *Current Cycle: 14.5 hrs*). Click **"Generate Route & HOS Log"**. Then click the **"Simulate Trip"** button above the map.

**🗣️ What to Say:**
> *"Let's test a real commercial trip: Indianapolis, Indiana down to Dallas, Texas — roughly 900 miles with 14.5 hours of cycle already consumed.*
>
> *Notice our engine automatically supports deadhead repositioning: if a truck’s current location differs from the shipper pickup, it routes the deadhead leg separately, logs a 15-minute origin pre-trip inspection, and tracks loaded miles independently.*
>
> *When we click 'Generate Route', the backend computes the truck-compliant route, geocodes waypoints, and models every mandatory stop.*
>
> *If we hit 'Simulate Trip', our custom animated truck travels along the actual highway path. Notice our live floating HUD ticker at the top-left: it shows real-time duty status, simulated road speed at 55 miles per hour, odometer progression, and a live countdown to the next mandatory 30-minute break or 10-hour sleeper reset."*

---

### Part 3: The 24-Hour Digital ELD Log Sheet & Export (1:45 – 2:45)
**🖥️ On Screen:** Scroll down to the **"Electronic Logging Device (ELD) Daily Sheet"**. Hover over grid segments. Switch between **"Day 1"** and **"Day 2"** tabs. Highlight the official header and click **"Export All 2 Days Logbook (PDF)"** (or show the print preview dialog).

**🗣️ What to Say:**
> *"Now let's examine the centerpiece of this project: the daily 24-Hour ELD Log Sheet.*
>
> *Rather than a simple static table, we developed an SVG grid with 96 discrete 15-minute increments across 4 standardized duty lines: Line 1 Off Duty, Line 2 Sleeper Berth, Line 3 Driving, and Line 4 On Duty Not Driving.*
>
> *Notice our strict compliance with FMCSA rules:*
> 1. *The shift starts Day 1 with 1 hour of on-duty inspection and cargo loading.*
> 2. *After driving reaches 8 hours, our engine automatically forces a mandatory 30-minute off-duty meal break.*
> 3. *At the 11-hour driving limit and 14-hour duty window, it inserts a 10-hour sleeper berth reset.*
> 4. *Every 1,000 miles, a 15-minute fueling stop on Line 4 is scheduled.*
>
> *Most importantly, our Midnight Splitter guarantees the fundamental FMCSA invariant: exactly 24.0 hours are accounted for on every single calendar day.*
>
> *Selecting 'Day 2' seamlessly synchronizes the map polyline with the second day's log, and drivers or dispatchers can click 'Export Logbook' to print or generate an official audit-ready multi-day PDF with full DOT headers, co-driver fields, and 70-hour recap balances."*

---

### Part 4: Backend Architecture & HOS Simulation Methodology (2:45 – 3:45)
**🖥️ On Screen:** Switch to VS Code. Open `backend/hos_engine/services/hos_simulator.py` and `midnight_splitter.py`.

**🗣️ What to Say:**
> *"Let's take a look under the hood at the backend methodology in Django.*
>
> *In `hos_simulator.py`, we implemented a chronological state machine rather than heuristic approximations. We track running clocks for continuous driving, 14-hour shift duty windows, and the 70-hour / 8-day rolling cycle.*
>
> *The biggest technical challenge in trucking compliance is midnight boundary transitions. A 10-hour sleeper berth reset might start at 8:00 PM on Day 1 and finish at 6:00 AM on Day 2.*
>
> *In `midnight_splitter.py`, our algorithm slices continuous duty segments at exactly 00:00 midnight. It calculates exact fractional hour allocations, linearly interpolates start and end mile markers, and updates cumulative duty totals so both Day 1 and Day 2 balance to precisely 24.0 hours."*

---

### Part 5: Commercial Truck Routing Engine & Turn-by-Turn Instructions (3:45 – 4:45)
**🖥️ On Screen:** Open `backend/hos_engine/services/routing_service.py` in VS Code, then switch back to browser and expand the **"Turn-by-Turn Route Instructions"** accordion below the map.

**🗣️ What to Say:**
> *"For routing, we built `RoutingService.py` using OSRM and Valhalla commercial truck corridor profiles with geodesic Haversine fallbacks.*
>
> *Unlike standard car GPS, we enforce interstate commercial clearance checks for a 13-foot 6-inch height and an 80,000-pound Gross Vehicle Weight rating.*
>
> *On the frontend, our `RouteInstructions` component translates this data into step-by-step navigation instructions: highway names, distances, maneuver turn icons, and milestone tags identifying the Deadhead Repositioning vs Loaded Freight Transit legs."*

---

### Part 6: Automated Test Suite & Conclusion (4:45 – 5:00)
**🖥️ On Screen:** Open terminal in VS Code and run `python manage.py test`. Show all 9 tests passing (`OK`). Switch to the GitHub repo tab.

**🗣️ What to Say:**
> *"Quality and test coverage were top priorities. We built a comprehensive automated test suite covering the 11-hour driving cap, 14-hour shift window, 30-minute rest breaks, 70-hour cycle depletion, and 24.0-hour midnight partitioning. All 9 unit and integration tests pass with 100% accuracy.*
>
> *Both the live Vercel application and the GitHub repository are fully documented and ready for review. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your feedback!"*

## 💡 Quick Tips for a Flawless Recording
1. **Resolution:** Record in 1080p full screen so the SVG grid lines and code are crisp.
2. **Hard Refresh:** Refresh `https://spotter-ai-tms.vercel.app` before starting to make sure you have the latest production bundle loaded.
3. **Pacing:** Keep a brisk, steady pace. Don't worry about reading every word verbatim — use the bold bullet points as your anchor points.
4. **Links in Description:** When submitting your Loom video, include:
   - **Live App:** `https://spotter-ai-tms.vercel.app`
   - **GitHub Repo:** `https://github.com/affan004/spotter-ai-tms`
   - **Tech Stack:** Django REST Framework + React + Leaflet + SVG ELD Engine
